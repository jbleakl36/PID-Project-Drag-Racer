### CAD

### Onshape Document:

### Pictures
![Full thing](https://github.com/jbleakl36/PID-Project-Drag-Racer/assets/112979207/0df4b95c-a3e1-4327-9ccc-e9ec51acf320)



### Wheels
![Big wheel](https://github.com/jbleakl36/PID-Project-Drag-Racer/assets/112979207/2bbb251b-38d3-4085-83df-4301b831f2f4)

Fully 3-D printed! Used in tandem with the gears and the DC Motors to propel the car forward.

Wheels are made of acrylic. We used a dowery rod for the axle. The coasters (things in pink) are used to keep the wheels from slanting
they were challanging to make due to the fact that the dowery rod has an unconventional size that had to be accomidated for.

### Dc motor setup with gears
![DC](https://github.com/jbleakl36/PID-Project-Drag-Racer/assets/112979207/899338d7-f561-418d-af17-b26badcfd963)
![DC 2](https://github.com/jbleakl36/PID-Project-Drag-Racer/assets/112979207/4338db37-61f9-4956-9b24-7d33b60ecae7)

The gears are attached to the DC Motors, they are friction fit. Nick designed specialized 3-D Parts that keep the motors in place.

### Car body
![Body](https://github.com/jbleakl36/PID-Project-Drag-Racer/assets/112979207/603f1cd5-2ab4-4c82-b97f-689d4e46f99d)

This piece has undergone many changes, mostly just adding new holes for the increasing roster of parts that we needed.
### Axle holder
![Holy savior](https://github.com/jbleakl36/PID-Project-Drag-Racer/assets/112979207/758b952c-f8f8-447c-8c79-90c5b89f197b)

This little guy holds the back axle which makes sure that it can rotate properly
