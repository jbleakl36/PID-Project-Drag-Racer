# PID-Project-Drag-Racer
By Joshua and Nick
# The plan
We wanted to make a drag racer with PID serving as it's cruise control, and for a long time that was what we were making.
But we chose to measure it via a photointerupter, which is exactly what a PID wheel does. So we pivoted, to a PID wheel.
A PID wheel uses a photointerupter to detect the speed of the wheel, that is when we use a rotary motor to change the PID values.
Everything in a project can be subject to change, make sure to keep that in mind.

### Wheels

This collection of parts are fully 3-D printed! Used in tandem with the gears and the DC Motors to propel the car forward.

Wheels are made of acrylic. We used a dowery rod for the axle. The coasters (parts in pink) are used to keep the wheels from slanting
they were challanging to make due to the fact that the dowery rod has an unconventional size that had to be accomidated for.

### Dc motor setup with gears

The gears are attached to the DC Motors, they are friction fit. Nick designed specialized 3-D Parts that keep the motors in place.

### Car body

This piece has undergone many changes, mostly just adding new holes for the increasing roster of parts that we needed.
### Axle holder

This little guy holds the back axle which makes sure that it can rotate properly

### Photointerupter Bracket

This piece is designed to hold the photointerupter in place so it can detect the movement of the wheels thus allowing 
steady data to flow so that we can properly undergo PID tuning.

# Assembly/Construction of the Vehicle
 Assembly came rather fast in the development of our project. We first created a drawing containing all of our acryllic parts.
 After that was printed we exported every part that we wanted to be 3-D printed. Time passes and eventually we get our 3-D parts,
 it was always exciting when this happened because that mean't that we could advance further into the development of our project.
 The first major problem we had was the fact that our car body had no holes for the battery pack and the metro. So Nick proceded to
 drill in the holes that were missing from the final part (makes sure to always double check your drawing, hit the refresh button 
 while your at it!). Unfortunatly Nick drilled the holes in the wrong spots (for the metro specifically) so we eventually had to 
 re-print the car body as we also in tandem with the missing holes added more holes for more parts (Nick still did a good job on the 
 drilling despite the errors along the way). Next up were the wheels, now the front wheels used a Dowery rod as the axle which when 
 creating coasters (the pink parts that surrond both wheels) I struggled to find a good size (I initially didn't use a calipher because
 we planned to 3-D print the axle for a short while) until around the 5th attempt which proved successful. The gears and the the axle 
 in the back were at first unable to fully rotate, so we created the axle holder (the white part shown above) to hold said axle in place
 while rotation was at hand. Sometimes the coasters come loose which is an issue cause it makes the small wheels unwieldy.
